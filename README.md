# product-comparison-demo
A small project to demonstrate concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and reflection.
The project uses Web API to deliver data to an MVC application. 
Since the front-end of the project uses Vue.js there are no models being passed to the views.

Roslyn is included in the project because I want the project to be able to be built easily.
If Roslyn wasn't included in this project then it would require a Clean before a Build.

I did not want to include npm in this example so I chose to include the script files.

Nuget packages will automatically be restored on Build.
